1. Stochastic Simulation (Gillespie) Algorithm implemented in Deterministic_Analytic_Methods for comparison of stochastic to deterministic (analytical and numerical) methods to model mass-action kinetics.
2. Random sampling, 1D particle hopping, and continuous random walks associated with Brownian Motion

Originally implemented in Jupyter notebooks
